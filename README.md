intelligent_traffic_light

By means many fondamental concepts of Computer Science,I'd like to make up an intelligent mechanism to improve 
traffic congestion. 
Why many car must be stopped by a red light if other side there's no car that are passing?
It's evident that every traffic light it must be intelligent. It's more important for this aspect to consider the 
utility of several sensors.

Targets:

1. First target is to make up a system that can rappresent a traffic light network of an area.
More important is the choise of structure for this aim.
